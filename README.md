# dotnetcore-sample
A sample project in dot net core (API, and Blazor with SOLID)

This my Open-source projects are great for getting started and serve as a good source for architecture reference. There are several open-source ASP.NET Core projects available in GitHub. These projects will help you learn ASP.NET Core technology in-depth, with different types of architecture and coding patterns.

Blazor is the framework that makes it easy to write C# code in the browser using a component. 
ASP.NET Core Blazor is a free, open-source Web Framework from Microsoft that allows developers to build interactive and modern Web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. It is a part of the ASP.NET Core framework. It enables developers to build rich web applications that can run on the client side using WebAssembly or on the server side using SignalR for real-time web functionality.
 *Blazor comes in two hosting models:*
* Blazor Server (Server-Side)*
 In the Blazor Server hosting model, the app is executed on the server, and a real-time connection is established between the server and the client using SignalR.
* Blazor WebAssembly (Client-Side)*
 Blazor WebAssembly is a single-page app (SPA) framework for building interactive web applications with .NET. It allows you to use C# and .NET to run in the browser on top of the WebAssembly binary instruction format, essentially allowing you to run .NET code in the browser.
